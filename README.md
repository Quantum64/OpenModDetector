# OpenModDetector

For several years now I've used the dependency injection library [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice). I'm trying [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) for something different this time.

More info on this project coming soon. Long story short selling premium resources only works for as long as people can't figure out how your plugin works. Once your plugins secrets have been discovered, others will reimplement your plugin and sell them as premium resources. This happened to my widly used Forge Mod Detector plugin a few months ago, and it is for that reason that I am reimplementing my own premium resource from the ground up as an open source project. Enjoy!
